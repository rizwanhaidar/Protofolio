## Project Structure

Inside this Astro project, you'll see:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page becomes a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where you can put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands run from the project root:
